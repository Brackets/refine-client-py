===================================
Google Refine Python Client Library
===================================

The Google Refine Python Client Library provides an interface to
communicating with a Google Refine server.

Currently, the following API is supported:

- project creation/import, deletion, export
- facet computation

  - text
  - text filter
  - numeric
  - blank
  - starred & flagged
  - ... extensible class

- 'engine': managing multiple facets and their computation results
- sorting & reordering
- clustering
- transforms
- transposes
- single and mass edits
- annotation (star/flag)
- column

  - move
  - add
  - split
  - rename
  - reorder
  - remove

Configuration
=============

By default the Google Refine server URL is http://127.0.0.1:3333
The environment variables `GOOGLE_REFINE_HOST` and `GOOGLE_REFINE_PORT`
enable overriding the host & port.

In order to run all tests, a live Refine server is needed. No existing projects
are affected.

Installation
============

#. Run tests:

   make smalltest  # if no Refine server available

   make test

TODO

The API so far has been filled out from building a test suite to carry out the
actions in `David Huynh's Refine tutorial <http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf>`_ which while certainly showing off a
wide range of Refine features doesn't cover the entire suite. Notable exceptions
currently include:

- reconciliation
- undo/redo
- Freebase
- join columns
- columns from URL
